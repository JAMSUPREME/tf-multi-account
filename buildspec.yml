# TODO: probably move this down one folder
# TODO: Figure out if we can make this dynamic? We will need to use the outputs from TF
#   Maybe pass dynamic buildspec instead of this static file... ?
#   Or pass the ECR ID as its own env variable?
# TODO: also somehow grab latest git SHA and add that as a tag (instead of latest)
